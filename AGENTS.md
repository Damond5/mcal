# Agents.md - Development Guidelines

## Prerequisites
- **Java**: OpenJDK 17 (or 11) required for Android builds. Avoid development versions like 25.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands
- **Check environment**: `fvm flutter doctor`
- **Install dependencies**: `fvm flutter pub get`
- **Build debug**: `fvm flutter run`
- **Build release APK**: `fvm flutter build apk`
- **Build web**: `fvm flutter build web`
- **Build Linux**: `fvm flutter build linux`
- **Lint**: `fvm flutter analyze`
- **Run all tests**: `fvm flutter test`
- **Run single test**: `fvm flutter test test/widget_test.dart`

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**: Group flutter/material first, then third-party packages, then local imports
- **Quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes/widgets
- **Constructors**: Use `const` for stateless widgets and immutable objects
- **Null safety**: Use `!` operator for non-null assertions, `?` for nullable types
- **Error handling**: Add null checks to prevent crashes, display user-friendly messages
- **Formatting**: Follow flutter_lints rules, 2-space indentation
- **Types**: Explicitly type variables when not obvious from context
- **State management**: Use StatefulWidget for simple state, consider providers for complex apps

## Design Choices for Simple Calendar App

- **Calendar Library**: Chose `table_calendar` (v3.2.0) for its
highly customizable and feature-packed calendar widget, supporting
month/week views, selection, and formatting.
- **Calendar Weeks**: Calendar weeks start on Monday for consistency with international standards and rcal.
- **Week Numbers**: Display week numbers on the left side of the calendar for improved navigation and consistency with calendar applications.
- **State Management**: Used Flutter's built-in `StatefulWidget`
for managing calendar state (focused day, selected day) to keep it
simple and avoid over-engineering. For app-level state like themes,
implemented `ChangeNotifier` with `Provider` pattern.
- **Theme System**: Implemented comprehensive dark mode support with
`ThemeProvider` for state management, `shared_preferences` for persistence,
and theme-aware styling throughout the app including calendar theming.
- **Modularity**: Created separate `CalendarWidget` class to
encapsulate calendar logic, making the main app cleaner and
reusable. Organized code into logical directories (providers, themes, widgets).
- **Date Formatting**: Integrated `intl` package for proper date
formatting (e.g., `DateFormat.yMd()`) instead of string
manipulation, ensuring localization support.
- **UI Layout**: Used a `Column` with `TableCalendar` and a `Text`
widget to display selected day, providing immediate feedback on
user interactions. Added responsive constraints to prevent overflow.
- **Error Handling**: Added null checks for selected day to
prevent crashes and display user-friendly messages.
- **Performance**: Kept the app lightweight with no unnecessary
rebuilds; state updates only trigger when needed. Used efficient
theme rebuilding with `Consumer` widgets.
- **Code Quality**: Fixed all lints (e.g., added `key` parameters,
made state class public, ensured dependencies are explicit in
pubspec.yaml). Followed Material Design 3 guidelines.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with widget tests for GUI
functionality (app loading, calendar display, day selection, theme toggle
interactions) and unit tests for business logic (ThemeProvider and EventProvider state
management, persistence). Used Flutter's testing framework with mockito
for SharedPreferences mocking. All tests run via `fvm flutter test` to
ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
    - Hybrid testing approach: Unit tests for isolated logic (models, services), integration tests for end-to-end workflows (UI interactions, real plugins). Run units with `fvm flutter test`, integrations with `fvm flutter test integration_test/` (desktop) or `--device-id <id>` (device).
   - **Event System**: Implemented event management fully aligned with rcal's event specification,
   using individual Markdown files per event (one file per event with sanitized title as filename) in the app's calendar subdirectory within the documents directory. Each file contains event details in Markdown format: Date (YYYY-MM-DD or range), Time (HH:MM or all-day), Description, and Recurrence (none/daily/weekly/monthly). Supports add/view/edit/delete
   events with title, start/end dates, start/end times, description, and recurrence. All-day events supported. Events displayed as markers on calendar days,
   with list view for selected day showing expanded recurring instances. CRUD operations via dialogs with full field editing. Extensible for
   notifications and Git sync.
   - **Filename Storage**: Added `filename` field to `Event` model to store the actual filename used for persistence, ensuring correct file deletion and updates even when multiple events have similar titles and counters are appended.
  - **Recurrence Handling**: Recurring events are expanded into individual instances for display and interaction.
  - **Sync System**: Implemented Git-based synchronization using `SyncService`
  class with `Process.run` for executing git commands in the app's calendar subdirectory within the documents directory.
  Remote URL stored in `shared_preferences`. Supports init, pull, push, and status
  operations with user-friendly error handling. Integrated into `EventProvider`
  for seamless sync functionality. Added automatic syncing: pulls changes on app start if initialized, pushes changes after event add/update/delete operations. Manual sync available via `SyncButton` in app bar
  opening a dialog with buttons for Init Sync (with URL text field), Pull, Push, Status.
  Uses async/await with loading indicators and displays results/errors via SnackBar.
  GUI automatically updates after sync operations by reloading events and using a refresh counter to force calendar rebuilds, ensuring markers and event lists reflect changes without manual refresh.
  - **Auto Sync Enhancements**: Added configurable auto sync settings (`SyncSettings` model) stored in `shared_preferences`, including enable/disable auto sync, sync frequency (5-60 minutes), and sync on app resume. Implemented periodic background sync using `workmanager` on Android/iOS (minimum 15 minutes) and `Timer` on Linux. Added conflict resolution UI for merge conflicts during pull, with options to prefer remote, keep local, or cancel. Auto sync on resume pulls if >5 minutes since last sync. Settings accessible via "Settings" in sync menu.
 - **Notification System**: Implemented local notifications using `flutter_local_notifications` (v17.2.2) for cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Linux). Consistent with rcal's daemon mode: notifications 30 minutes before timed events, midday the day before for all-day events. Singleton `NotificationService` handles scheduling/unscheduling, prevents duplicates by tracking IDs, and requests permissions on app start. Integrated into `EventProvider` for automatic scheduling on event CRUD operations and loading existing events. Added LinuxNotificationDetails for proper Linux support with notification daemons like Dunst, and initialized timezone database for zoned scheduling. On Linux, uses a periodic timer to check for upcoming events and show immediate notifications, as scheduled notifications may not persist when the app is closed.
- **Workmanager Update**: Updated `workmanager` to version 0.9.0 for better compatibility with newer Flutter versions.
- **Android Build Enhancements**: Enabled core library desugaring in Android build to support `flutter_local_notifications` v17.2.2 requirements.
- **Future Extensibility**: Designed with room for features like
event lists, custom themes, or data persistence by making dates
configurable. Theme system is extensible for additional themes.
- **Consistency with rcal**: All features should be consistent with https://github.com/Damond5/rcal, adapted for a Flutter GUI app.
