# Simple Calendar App

A lightweight, cross-platform calendar application built with Flutter. This app provides a simple and intuitive interface for viewing and selecting dates on a calendar.

## Description

The Simple Calendar App is a Flutter-based application that displays an interactive calendar widget. Users can navigate through months, select specific days, and view the selected date in a formatted manner. The app leverages the `table_calendar` package for robust calendar functionality and supports multiple platforms including Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, web, and Windows.

## Features

- **Interactive Calendar**: Navigate through months and select days with ease.
- **Date Selection**: Click on any day to select it and see the formatted date displayed below the calendar.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on mobile (Android/iOS), desktop (Linux/macOS/Windows), and web platforms.
- **Customizable Theme**: Built with Flutter's Material Design, allowing for easy theming.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading and smooth performance.
- **Localization Ready**: Uses the `intl` package for date formatting, supporting multiple locales.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A compatible IDE (e.g., Android Studio, VS Code) with Flutter extensions
- For mobile development: Android SDK (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS)
- For desktop/web: Appropriate development tools for your target platform

### Installation

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mcal
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   - For mobile/emulator:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
   - For web:
     ```bash
     flutter run -d chrome
     ```
   - For desktop (e.g., Linux):

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your device or in the browser.
2. The calendar will display the current month by default.
3. Use the navigation arrows to switch between months.
4. Tap on any day to select it.
5. The selected date will be displayed below the calendar in a readable format (e.g., "Selected day: 10/23/2025").
6. If no day is selected, it shows "No day selected".

The app is designed for simplicity, making it easy to integrate into larger projects or use as a standalone date picker.
