# TODO
- Tests leave a lot of events in the calendar
- Rerun all integration tests on android device
- Build and test on android device manually
- Add more integration tests
- Integration Testing: Perform end-to-end tests with actual Git repos (initialized and uninitialized) to ensure sync operations (init, pull, push, status) handle all edge cases
- Potential Enhancements: If needed, add features like improved error messaging for sync failures or support for additional Git auth methods
- Deployment Verification: Build for production (e.g., APK, Linux desktop) to confirm Rust linking works across platforms
