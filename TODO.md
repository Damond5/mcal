# TODO

- fix agent instructions so they can find the build and run commands
  - simplify, by removing docs/platforms workflows and just having simple instructions in AGENTS.md
  - use Makefile as hardcoded workflows and documentation for those workflows (for now android and linux workflows)
    - AGENTS.md should tell agents to use those workflows with make
- integration tests?
