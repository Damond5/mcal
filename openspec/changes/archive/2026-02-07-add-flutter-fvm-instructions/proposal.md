## Why

Add Flutter Version Management (fvm) instructions to AGENTS.md to ensure all AI agents and developers use consistent Flutter versions. This prevents version compatibility issues, improves team collaboration, and ensures reproducible development environments.

## What Changes

Add a comprehensive "Flutter Development (fvm)" section to AGENTS.md documenting all common Flutter development tasks using fvm instead of flutter directly. This includes commands for running, building, testing, analyzing, formatting, and managing Flutter applications. The section will show how fvm integrates with the existing Makefile commands.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- fvm-based Flutter development workflow instructions covering all common development tasks

### Modified Capabilities

- Updated documentation for Flutter commands to use fvm prefix consistently

## Impact

Improves development environment consistency across team members, ensures version compatibility, makes onboarding easier for new developers, and maintains seamless integration with existing Makefile infrastructure.
